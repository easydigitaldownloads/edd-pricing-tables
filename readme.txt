Easily create pricing tables for your downloads

== Description ==

> This plugin requires [Easy Digital Downloads](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/easy-digital-downloads/ "Easy Digital Downloads") in order to function.

Creating a pricing table for your downloads has never been easier. Simply add features to your download and use the included shortcode to display your pricing table on any page. The user interface for creating a pricing table is built directly into the download edit screen you're already familiar with - no new screens cluttering your WordPress admin. Set up and pricing table management is intuitive since the pricing table uses information already provided for a download.

Features:

- Easy pricing table creation and management. Add features to your download and display the pricing table using the included shortcode.
- Variable pricing support. Drag and drop your existing pricing options to change the order of the downloads shown
- Multiple download support. Create a pricing table with completely separate downloads by using the included shortcode.
- Developer-friendly. No inline CSS styling. Easy to customize via simple CSS or hooks. Display a pricing table anywhere using the shortcode or included function call.
- Easy Digital Downloads integration. If the download (or variable pricing option) is added to the cart but the customer returns to the pricing page, the button on the pricing table will show "checkout".
- Advanced options. Override the pricing option name, enter a description, enter the period, feature any pricing option, change the button text.
